// stb_dxt.h - v1.12 - DXT1/DXT5 compressor - public domain
// original by fabian "ryg" giesen - ported to C by stb
// use '#define STB_DXT_IMPLEMENTATION' before including to create the implementation
//
// USAGE:
//   call stb_compress_dxt_block() for every block (you must pad)
//     source should be a 4x4 block of RGBA data in row-major order;
//     Alpha channel is not stored if you specify alpha=0 (but you
//     must supply some constant alpha in the alpha channel).
//     You can turn on dithering and "high quality" using mode.
//
// version history:
//   v1.12  - (ryg) fix bug in single-color table generator
//   v1.11  - (ryg) avoid racy global init, better single-color tables, remove dither
//   v1.10  - (i.c) various small quality improvements
//   v1.09  - (stb) update documentation re: surprising alpha channel requirement
//   v1.08  - (stb) fix bug in dxt-with-alpha block
//   v1.07  - (stb) bc4; allow not using libc; add STB_DXT_STATIC
//   v1.06  - (stb) fix to known-broken 1.05
//   v1.05  - (stb) support bc5/3dc (Arvids Kokins), use extern "C" in C++ (Pavel Krajcevski)
//   v1.04  - (ryg) default to no rounding bias for lerped colors (as per S3TC/DX10 spec);
//            single color match fix (allow for inexact color interpolation);
//            optimal DXT5 index finder; "high quality" mode that runs multiple refinement steps.
//   v1.03  - (stb) endianness support
//   v1.02  - (stb) fix alpha encoding bug
//   v1.01  - (stb) fix bug converting to RGB that messed up quality, thanks ryg & cbloom
//   v1.00  - (stb) first release
//
// contributors:
//   Rich Geldreich (more accurate index selection)
//   Kevin Schmidt (#defines for "freestanding" compilation)
//   github:ppiastucki (BC4 support)
//   Ignacio Castano - improve DXT endpoint quantization
//   Alan Hickman - static table initialization
